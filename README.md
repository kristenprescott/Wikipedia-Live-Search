# Wikipedia Live Search

## First things first...


This project was **heavily** inspired by [this post by Nick Coughlin](https://ncoughlin.com/posts/react-xss-attack/). Really, it's almost a direct copy including informative comments. I followed along for learning purposes and I can highly recommend checking out Nick's site - whether you're a newer developer or more experienced, there are a lot of great posts over there.

## Overview

Simple little search-as-you-type searchbar for Wikipedia using the [Wikipedia API](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php). I'll link their [API sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox) here as well for anyone interested. No API key needed!

Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and using [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) for http requests.

## Getting started

Clone this repo to your local machine, then run `yarn install` (or `npm install` if you'd prefer) to install the dependencies. Then run `yarn start` to open a local instance in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`).
